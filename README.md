A practical journey demonstrating how JS/ TS developers can seamlessly integrate AI capabilities into web applications and services using AI Foundry.

</header>

- **Who this is for:** Developers, AI Engineers, Software development managers, Testers.
- **What you'll learn:** This sets of journeys are designed to get you from _I haven't worked with AI_, to _building local AI prototypes_ and eventually to _creating a production-ready AI application_.
- **What you'll build:** Local AI prototypes, deploy models on Azure, add AI models to web applications and extend them with Azure services for RAG, search, and orchestration.

### How to get started

1. Right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.
2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - **We recommend creating a public repository**, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Give your repository a name, such as `JS-AI-Build-a-thon`
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
3. After your new repository is created, **wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page**. [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions) will automatically update to the next step. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README.
4. Open a new browser tab, and work on the steps in your second tab while you read the instructions in this tab.
